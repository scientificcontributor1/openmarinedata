Publish your data paper in 15 min!

## Context
The access to scientific data is slowed down by the need for scientists to publish them. Collecting data is a complicated task and costly. There is *de facto* an incentive to keep the data until you publish them which can take several years. Then you can say your project has been a success and if someone reads the paper and contact you, you can send the raw data (if they're not lost on a failed harddrive).

Data collection can also lack of originality so the publication in classical peer-reviewed journal implies you have to wrap it up to show the importance of the topic or find some nice analyses to show these data were interesting.

## Aim
With *openmarinedata*, you provide your name, affiliations, acknowledgment, and you upload your data. A paper will be automatically created and associated with a DOI. You can select the type of figures you want to include based on a variety of template figures. You can also include your *R* codes to include a specific figures you'd like to be in the final paper. If you're motivated you can also add your own text in the intro / M&M / Results or discussion sections but you don't have to.

## We're just starting...
Here are the steps we're looking to follow. Any contribution to the codes of this application are more than welcomed. Feel free to create a template for your own field.

### Satellite tracking data paper
Our first example is tagging data. It's a good one as a satellite tag cost ~$4000 so these data are very costly to get. Basically you really don't want other people to access them before you publish them. Obviously it is a big waste for the scientific community and species management and conservation. On the flip side, science is projects and money which depend on your ability to publish paper. It's circular looping...

### Expanding to other marine data
Then we'll apply these concept to other marine data: buoys, boats tracking, fish sampling (weight, length, maturity, ...), and any other kind of marine data.

### Towards open-peer-reviewed and forking of papers
Another step will be to include an open peer-review component. Anyone can contribute to your paper. If you validate the comment, the person become an author. 

Someone can also use your data to combine with her/his data, basically adding more points. You are then an author of the new paper (your paper is automatically cited in the new one). You can also be the one author who adds more data to your previous paper which create a new paper.

### Value of your papers (h-i-j-%$ - index)
The value of your paper will be assessed by:
- the number of times your doi has been used
- how many people contributed to your paper
- how diverse is the community which used the data (e.g. only in the same field, or from oceanographers to geneticists to economists)

## Disclaimer
*openmarinedata* doesn't mean that you collect without thinking. We are convinced that scientific protocols and design are critical to get reliable and thoughtful scientific information.

## How it works
- Click on ... website
- Give your name, affiliations, or ORCID number
- Upload your data
- Add the acknowledgments (project number etc)
- if you really feel there is an added value, you can include some text on top on the one that is automatically generated
- click on submit and you'll get your doi
